# HiC Pipelines
Pipelines for processing HiC data

# libraries made

Libraries were made by https://phasegenomics.com/

# Sequencing

HiC libraries were sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq on S4 flowcells by https://www.usuhs.edu/ 

# Sequencing QC
## FastQC

add table with sequencing reads per sample
Push fastQC reports .pdf to folder in this github


# HiC sequencing data pipeline

See `QC_and_Preprocessing` for scripts used to combine fastq lane files and run [fastqc](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) on samples  
See `Juicer` for scripts used to run the [Juicer](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer) pipeline and do various analyses
